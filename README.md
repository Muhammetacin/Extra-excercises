# Jukebox

- Repository: `jukebox`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation Challenge`
- Duration: take your time
- Deployment strategy : `n/a`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## The Mission

The class has put together a playlist for fridays, and you decide to build some jukebox functionality around it.

This exercise provides you with a chance to get some extra JS practise.
Every todo is a separate mini exercise, and you can skip some if you're stuck to come back to them later.

You'll rehearse:
- Functions
- If, for and foreach
- Objects

> If there is no restriction mentioned in the task, you can use all language features you want to use

All data you need and the instructions can be found in [this file](jukebox.js).
As always, levels are marked as must have (🌱), doable nice to haves (🌼) or hard nice to haves (🌳).
Best of luck! 🎶
